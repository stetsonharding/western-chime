# *Overview*
#### This project is a mock-up e-commerce website that fetches the Punk API. My goal of this project was to incorporate a lot of the functionality found on a general e-commerce website using React.js. These functionalities include getting the data, a modal to learn more about the item selected, searching items, favorite items for later use, adding/removing items to and from the users cart, changing and updating the quantity of items selected, pagination for a user friendly experience and to boost performance load times, updating the users price, taxes, and grand total based off items in the users cart, a checkout page with a checkout form and a place to enter promo codes for a discount.
